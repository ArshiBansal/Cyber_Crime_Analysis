# 💻 Cyber Crime (2019–2024) Analysis

## 📌 Introduction

Cybersecurity has become one of the most critical challenges of the digital age. With the exponential growth of data and digital systems, incidents involving data breaches, unauthorized access, and digital fraud have risen sharply. This project presents an in-depth visual and statistical analysis of **cyber crime incidents reported between 2019 and 2024**, aiming to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights that can inform policy decisions and risk mitigation strategies.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As cyber threats continue to evolve, understanding their nature, frequency, and impact has become essential for organizations and governments alike. The absence of timely insights into cyber crime trends can lead to poor incident response, underprepared sectors, and increased vulnerability of sensitive data.

**Goal**:  
To analyze cyber crime incident data across multiple dimensions and answer key questions such as:
- Which sectors are most frequently targeted?
- What are the most common types of incidents?
- How has the number of affected data subjects changed over time?
- What actions are typically taken following an incident?
- What is the ratio of cyber to non-cyber incidents?

This analysis helps in identifying weak links, improving cyber resilience, and allocating resources effectively.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Healthcare, Finance, and Government sectors** are consistently the most targeted.
- A significant number of incidents result in **no further action**, indicating possible gaps in enforcement or policy.
- **Phishing, Unauthorised Access, and Misdelivery** are among the most frequent cyber threats.
- The **average number of affected individuals** shows seasonal spikes and sudden dips, reflecting changing threat vectors and detection/reporting behavior.
- **Non-Cyber incidents** still outnumber cyber incidents but cyber threats are growing steadily.
